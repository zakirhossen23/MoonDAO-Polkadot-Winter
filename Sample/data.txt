Goal:
Making the Conscious Nona community clubhouse more sustainable with natural materials

Come with ideas how we can make the Conscious Nona clubhouse fully sustainable together. The clubhouse is an important meeting place to inspire members to adopt greener lifestyles and collaborative events will foster a culture of sustainability.
Some ideas: Solar panels adorn the rooftop, harnessing the sun's energy to power the facility, while large windows and skylights maximise natural light, reducing the need for artificial lighting.
